### **Final Project Part 2** 
<br/>
**Note about change in project scope from previous outline**<br/>
I will not be covering the opioid crisis from the early 2000's when it really started. I had originally planned on talking about how overprescribing from doctors and pain clinics, resulting from a push by big pharma companies, ended in wide scale addiction. Then, how that addiction switched to Heroin when the DEA began cracking down. I was also going to cover why Heroin has been switched to Fentanyl by drug cartels, because it is easier to smuggle and has a higher proffit margin. But, all of that would fill a book. So I will start the narative from about 2008 when prescriptions and illigal pills where harder to come by and the steady increase of Fentanyl started.
**Opening/Hook**<br/>
I will open the project with a personal story about the accidental overdose death of a coworker's nephew and a former intern for our department. I will not be showing his picture or using his real name. I will also speak about this to my coworker and her family before presenting it or using it at all in the project. I have mentioned it to her before and I believe it will be ok. <br/>
This person is a perfect example of why I picked this as a project and as a public saftey message. This person was not a hard core drug user and had never used heroin. But this person did occasionally take prescription pills at parties. His autopsy did show fentanyl in his system at time of death. But he would not have knowningly taking fentanyl. It is most likely a result of a prescription pill that he took that was counterfit and laced with fentanyl. <br/>
**Showing how quickly the Fentanyl Overdoses have increased**<br/>
Next I would like create a verson of the graph below to show how quickly the unintentional ingestion and overdose from Fentanyl has been. I will change this graph to empasize Fentanyl alone, leaving the other information there but depricating its importance by the use of grey in the color scheme.<br/>

**Demographic Incidence**<br/>
Next I would like to re-work the below pie charts, using somthing other than pie-charts to get the point across, that this is mostly a white lower to middle class problem. Also the largest age bracket is 45-54, which is not what people expect. However the second largest age bracket is more in line with peoples expectations, being 25-34.<br/>

**Questions I have asked and feedback received**<br/>
I have spokent to my coworker whos nephew died. The aspect that she was most interested in is what other more common recriational drugs is fentanyl appearing in in Allegheny county. This information is in one of my reports and I plan on including a list of common illicite substances that fentanyl has been found in. She was also interest in where the fentanyl is comming from. But I believe that would be out of the scope of a project this size. In class I received the same question, so I may include in the report a note about this issue. All of the fentanyl is comming up through Mexico with some of it being manufactured in Mexico and some being made in China and shipped to Mexico.<br/>
The main questions I have received as feedback are:<br/>
How did this problem start? (out of the scope of this project)<br/>
What drugs are laced with fentanyl and how can you tell? (I will mention that)<br/>
What group of people is mostly effected by this? (I will answer that in the demographics section)<br/>
Some questions about big pharma and who is responsible for this? (again, out of the scope of this project)
