### **Final Project Part 2** 
<br/>

**Opening/Hook**<br/>
I will open the project with a personal story about the accidental overdose death of a coworker's nephew and a former intern for our department. I will not be showing his picture or using his real name. I will also speak about this to my coworker and her family before presenting it or using it at all in the project. I have mentioned it to her before and I believe it will be ok. <br/>
This person is a perfect example of why I picked this as a project and as a public saftey message. This person was not a hard core drug user and had never used heroin. But this person did occasionally take prescription pills at parties. His autopsy did show fentanyl in his system at time of death. But he would not have knowningly taking fentanyl. It is most likely a result of a prescription pill that he took that was counterfit and laced with fentanyl. 
**Showing how quickly the Fentanyl Overdoses have increased**<br/>
Next I would like create a verson of the graph below to show how quickly the unintentional ingestion and overdose from Fentanyl has been. I will change this graph to empasize Fentanyl alone, leaving the other information there but depricating its importance by the use of grey in the color scheme.<br/>
