### **Final Project Part 3**
**Intended Audience**<br/>
I had thought of using a hypothetical intended audience of first responders and police officers. The idea was to have it be the type of report they would hear at their precinct which would prepare them for what they would encounter and give them a historical context for how things got to where they are now. However, not knowing what people in those professions would have for questions or concerns, I shifted the focus to more of a public health warning. This made it easier to empathize with the audience and predict what they might want to here. It also narrowed the focus away from the history of opioids to only what is happening right now. <br/>

During feedback sessions with a few classmates and one coworker I did receive allot of questions about how did we get to this point from the prescription pill crisis of the 90's and early 2000's, but I informed them that was beyond the scope of this project. The next most pressing question I got was "what kind of drugs will you find Fentanyl in?". This was more in line with the public health announcement focus. However my data set did give me difficulty in this area because it lists the drugs found in the system upon autopsy. But a coroner cannot decipher if an overdose victim had taken both cocaine laced with fentanyl and a xanax, or cocaine and a xanax laced with fentanyl. I do site a paper that looked at laboratory analyzed police drug seizures of cocaine, but it was not useful by itself as a public health alert. In my research I did discover that Fentanyl is always laced into something, because it is so potent. I also found a number of articles that listed common drugs found with Fentanyl in them from laboratory tests. This information is not from the data set that I used but from other articles. <br/>
**Design Problem**<br/>
Originally I had intended to create an animated gif of Allegheny County show the changed in the number of overdose death since 2008. However, there was two problems with trying to do this in datawrapper. One problem is that datawrapper uses TopoJSON or GioJSON map files for this process. They are a type of map used in GIS that work on a coordinate system to plug in data points. Datawrapper has a map of Pennsylvania loaded onto their website, but not one of Allegheny County. I did not have a data set for all of PA, only for Allegheny County. Another problem with datawrapper was the scaling for the colors in the map key. There was no way to make the scaling consistent with the data set from year to year other than just to eyeball it. I also had problems with most of the GIF creator websites I found as they were not very customizable. So I resolved to give a static map of Allegheny County from the last year the data was available. I did learn that this can be acomplished easily with GIS software. So that is a class I plan to take here at Heinz.<br/>
