#Final Project Part 1

**Opioids in PA**
I am interested in how the Opioid epidemic is affecting PA and if it has gotten better or worse in recent years. To show the severity of the issue I would like to focus on opioid related deaths. I have obtained a dataset of Opioid overdoses for the years 2017 and 2018. For dataviz I would like to show the most heavily impacted areas of the state and compare that with the same type of dataviz from earlier years to give a sense of the trajectory of the usage. 
The outline of the story that I am trying to tell:
A brief summation of how the issue first got started in the US.	
	Over prescribed by doctor’s/loose oversite of pharmacies.
The shift to illegal opioids/fentanyl after the medical establishment tightened up on oversite.
The current state of the crises & its predicted trajectory in the future.
I am having trouble thinking of a “call to action”, as of yet the presentation will be primarily informational.
