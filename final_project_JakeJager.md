## Final Project Part 1

**Opioids in PA**
I am interested in how the Opioid epidemic is affecting PA and if it has gotten better or worse in recent years. To show the severity of the issue I would like to focus on opioid related deaths. I have obtained a dataset of Opioid overdoses for the years 2017 and 2018. For dataviz I would like to show the most heavily impacted areas of the state and compare that with the same type of dataviz from earlier years to give a sense of the trajectory of the usage.<br/> 
<br/> **Rough Outline** <br/> 
The outline of the story that I am trying to tell:<br/> 
A brief summation of how the issue first got started in the US.	<br/> 
	Over prescribed by doctor’s/loose oversite of pharmacies.<br/> 
The shift to illegal opioids/fentanyl after the medical establishment tightened up on oversite.<br/> 
The current state of the crises & its predicted trajectory in the future.<br/> 
I am having trouble thinking of a “call to action”, as of yet the presentation will be primarily informational.<br/>

<br/>The below chart clearly shows how bad Ohio is compared to other states. Perhaps making PA a red dot on this graph would help with comparison.<br/>

**Data Sources**<br/> 
So far I have identified two data sources:<br/> 
The first dataset has the estimated overdose deaths by county for 2017 & 2018. The total for Pennsylvania has gone down slightly. I would like to show this through contrasting maps of the state that are color coded to show the most impacted areas year to year. <br/>
[Estimated PA Drug Overdose Deaths from OpenData PA](https://data.pa.gov/stories/s/Pennsylvania-Opioids/9q45-nckt/) <br/>
The second data source has much more information but is not specific to PA. It shows the overdose deaths for all 50 states from 2015 to present. It also breaks out the information by type of overdose; Heroin, Synthetic, Methadone, and others. This dataset could be used to show how PA stacks up against the rest of the country. I would also like to show what type of overdoses are happening here compared to other states.<br/>
[Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counds from CDC & Vital Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm)<br/>

For my final project I plan on using Shorthand, Infogram, and datawrapper. I may also use some excel functions to create graphs as I am very familiar with excel. I would like to make the project as intuitive as possible and communicate the general trend visually. The plan is to give a very breif but impactfull, visually and conceptually, overview of the entire country over the last few years and then contrast PA to that trend. It appears so far that the take away from that will be the PA overall is actually improving. This may make it more difficult for me to have a compelling "call to action".
